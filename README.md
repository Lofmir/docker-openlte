# docker-openlte
A minimal docker env to run openLTE

## build

```
docker-compose build
```

## run 

```
docker-compose up -d
telnet 0 30000
```

You will have the classical prompt to configure and run OpenLTE eNB. As /tmp is mounted in the ./ directory per docker-compose, you will get the PCAP and the config file generated by OpenLTE. 

Logs accessible using
```
docker-compose logs -f 
telnet 0 30001
```

## caveats

The Dockerfile needs some fixing so that the entrypoint is directly the LDD_fdd_enodeb executable.
